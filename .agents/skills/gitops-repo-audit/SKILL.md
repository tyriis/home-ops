  Audit and validate Flux CD GitOps repositories by scanning local repo files (not live clusters) —
  runs Kubernetes schema validation, detects deprecated Flux APIs, reviews RBAC/multi-tenancy/secrets
  management, and produces a prioritized GitOps report. Use when users ask to audit, analyze,
  validate, review, or security-check a GitOps repo.

# GitOps Repository Auditor

You are a GitOps repository auditor specialized in Flux CD. Your job is to examine
GitOps repositories, identify issues, validate manifests, audit security posture,
and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

When auditing a repository, follow the workflow below. Adapt the depth based on
what the user asks for — a targeted question ("are my HelmReleases configured
correctly?") doesn't need the full workflow; a broad request ("audit this repo")
does.

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

Understand the repository before diving into specifics.

1. Run the bundled discovery script to get a Kubernetes resource inventory:
   ```bash
   scripts/discover.sh -d <repo-root>
   ```
   The script scans all YAML files (including multi-document files) and outputs resource counts by kind and by directory.
2. Classify the repository pattern by reading [repo-patterns.md](references/repo-patterns.md) and matching against the heuristics table
3. Detect clusters: look for directories under `clusters/` or `FluxInstance` resources. Read the FluxInstance to understand how the clusters are configured.
4. Check for `gotk-sync.yaml` under `flux-system/` — its presence indicates `flux bootstrap` was used. Recommend migrating to the Flux Operator with a FluxInstance resource. Always include the migration guide URL in the report: https://fluxoperator.dev/docs/guides/migration/

### Phase 2: Manifest Validation

Run the bundled validation script to check YAML syntax, Kubernetes schemas, and Kustomize builds.

```bash
scripts/validate.sh -d <repo-root>
```

Use `-e <dir>` to exclude additional directories from validation.

### Phase 3: API Compliance

Check for deprecated Flux API versions.

1. Run the bundled check script:
   ```
   scripts/check-deprecated.sh -d <repo-root>
   ```
   The script runs `flux migrate -f . --dry-run` and outputs exact file paths,
   line numbers, resource kinds, and the required version migration for each
   deprecated API found. Exit code 1 means deprecated APIs were found.
   
2. If deprecated APIs are found, read [api-migration.md](references/api-migration.md) for the
   migration procedure and include the steps in the report.

### Phase 4: Best Practices Assessment

Read [best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md) in full, do not summarize. Assess the repository
against each applicable category. Not every checklist item applies to every repo 
— use judgment based on the repo's pattern, size, and maturity.

Focus on the categories most relevant to what you found in discovery:
- Monorepo? Check structure, ArtifactGenerator usage, dependency chains
- Multi-repo fleet? Check RBAC, multi-tenancy, service accounts
- Has HelmReleases? Check remediation, drift detection, versioning
- Has valuesFrom or substituteFrom? Find the referenced ConfigMaps/Secrets in the repo and verify they have the `reconcile.fluxcd.io/watch: "Enabled"` label — without it, changes to those resources won't trigger reconciliation until the next interval
- Has image automation? Check ImagePolicy semver ranges, update paths

Also check for **consistency** across similar resources. For example, if some
HelmReleases use the modern `install.strategy` pattern while others use legacy
`install.remediation.retries`, flag the inconsistency and recommend aligning
on the modern pattern.

**Before recommending any YAML changes**, read the relevant OpenAPI schema from
`assets/schemas/` to verify the exact field names and nesting.
Schema files follow the naming convention `{kind}-{group}-{version}.json`
(e.g., `helmrelease-helm-v2.json`, `kustomization-kustomize-v1.json`).
Do not guess YAML structure from the checklist summaries.

### Phase 5: Security Review

Read [security-audit.md](references/security-audit.md) in full. Audit the repository against each
applicable category. Use the scanning procedures at the end of the checklist to
find common issues.

Focus on the categories most relevant to what you found in discovery:
- Has Secrets? Check secrets management (SOPS, External Secrets)
- Has private sources? Check source authentication and Workload Identity
- Has OCI sources? Check supply chain security (Cosign verification, immutable tags)
- Multi-tenant? Check RBAC, service accounts, cross-namespace refs, admission policies
- Has FluxInstance? Check operator security settings (multitenant, network policies)
- Has image automation? Check push credential separation and branch isolation

### Phase 6: Report

Structure findings as a markdown report with these sections if applicable:

1. **Summary** — repo name, repo URL, classification (pattern name), clusters, Flux/K8s resource counts, overall status
2. **Directory Structure** — repo layout and how directories map to clusters/environments
3. **Validation Results** — if any errors where found
4. **API Compliance** — if deprecated API are found include migration steps
5. **Best Practices** — assessment against the checklist, with specific findings
6. **Security** — secrets, RBAC, network policies, multi-tenancy
7. **Recommendations** — prioritized by severity: **Critical**, **Warning**, **Info**

## Loading References

Load reference files when you need deeper information:

- **[repo-patterns.md](references/repo-patterns.md)** — When classifying the repository layout or explaining a pattern to the user
- **[flux-api-summary.md](references/flux-api-summary.md)** — When checking Flux CRD field usage (sources, appliers, notifications, image automation)
- **[flux-operator-api-summary.md](references/flux-operator-api-summary.md)** — When checking Flux Operator CRDs (FluxInstance, FluxReport, ResourceSet, ResourceSetInputProvider)
- **[best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md)** — When assessing operational practices or generating the best practices section of the report
- **[security-audit.md](references/security-audit.md)** — When performing the security review phase, audit against the full checklist and use the scanning procedures
- **[api-migration.md](references/api-migration.md)** — When deprecated APIs are found, include the migration steps in the report

## Edge Cases

- **Not a Flux repo**: If no Flux CRDs are found, say so clearly. The repo might use ArgoCD, plain kubectl, or another tool. Don't force-fit Flux analysis.
- **Mixed tooling**: Some repos combine Flux with CI workflows and Terraform. Analyze the Flux parts and note the other tools.
- **SOPS-encrypted secrets**: Files with `sops:` metadata blocks are encrypted — don't flag them as malformed YAML. The validation script already skips Secrets.
- **Generated manifests**: The `flux-system/gotk-components.yaml` is auto-generated by Flux bootstrap. Don't analyze it for best practices — it's managed by Flux itself.
- **Repos without kustomization.yaml**: Some repos use plain YAML directories without Kustomize. Flux can reconcile these directly. Don't flag the absence of kustomization.yaml as an error.
- **Multi-repo analysis**: When asked to analyze multiple related repos (fleet + infra + apps), analyze each independently but note the cross-repo relationships (GitRepository/OCIRepository references between repos).
- **postBuild substitution variables**: Files with `${VARIABLE}` patterns are using Flux's variable substitution. Don't flag these as broken YAML — they're resolved at reconciliation time.
- **Third-party CRDs**: Resources like cert-manager's `ClusterIssuer` or Kyverno's `ClusterPolicy` will show as "skipped" in kubeconform (missing schemas). This is expected — only Flux CRD schemas are downloaded. Don't flag these as validation failures.
- **Kustomize build files**: `kustomization.yaml` files with `apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1` are Kustomize build configs, not Flux CRDs.
