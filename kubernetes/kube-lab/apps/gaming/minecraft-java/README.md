Geyser is a program that allows Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers, allowing for true crossplay between both editions of the game.

## Floodgate

Floodgate is a hybrid mode plugin. It introduces new features:

- Ability to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers with Minecraft: Bedrock accounts without needing a paid Minecraft: Java Edition account.
- Ability to see Bedrock player skins on Java edition.
- Ability for plugins to send Bedrock forms.
- Ability to query players through the Global Api,
- Allowing Bedrock players to link to a Java account using Global Linking, or Local Linking.

This is something you install in addition to Geyser.
Unlike Geyser, Floodgate can only be installed as a plugin on Spigot (including Paper and forks), Bungeecord, Velocity, and as a mod on Fabric servers, and can only be utilized on servers that have it installed.
